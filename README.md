# react-concurrent-demo

Based on Dan Abramov's JSConf Iceland demo of concurrent rendering.

I found the code for this talk in the React repo:

https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/fixtures/concurrent/time-slicing

Then I ported it to a vite app, converted all the class components to functional,
updated some of the legacy api usages, fixed some bugs, converted it all to 
TypeScript, and generally cleaned up.
